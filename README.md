## üõ†Ô∏è Main features
Smart Surveillance offers the following key features:
- **Software-Based Motion Detection:** Detects movement through frame-to-frame analysis
- **Grayscale Imaging:** Enhances processing speed and accuracy
- **3√ó3 Grid Analysis:** Subdivides frames to pinpoint motion direction
- **Automated Camera Adjustment:** Motors center the camera on detected movement
- **Instant Image Alerts:** Captures and sends images via a Telegram bot




<br>

## üé¨ Get started
Embark on your journey to build and run your own system by following the steps outlined in this comprehensive guide!

#### Schematic
<p align="center"> <kbd> <img src="imgs/schematic.png"  width="750" height="450" alt="Scheme"> </kbd>

#### How to build
1. Assemble the Pan-Tilt servo support alongside the ESP32-CAM mounting bracket for the main foundation
2. Carefully insert the servos into the support structure
3. Connect the servos to the MSP432 Launchpad (refer to the pinout in the schematic above)
4. Position the ESP32-CAM onto its mounting bracket and link it to the MSP432 Launchpad (pinout details provided in the schematic above)
5. Power the servos through either the MSP432 Launchpad‚Äôs +5V or an external power source
6. Supply power to the ESP32-CAM via a USB adapter and its USB cable
7. Ensure all ground connections (GND) are properly linked together to maintain signal integrity and system stability
8. Place the system in your desired location

#### How to setup the software
1. Clone this GitHub repo by using:
```
git clone https://github.com//PossumLiarR/Smart-Surveillance.git
```
2. Import `code/MSP432P401R_Smart_Surveillance`'s project in **Code Composer Studio IDE**
3. Go to: _Project ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Arm Compiler ‚Üí Include Options_ and add the _source_ directory located in _simplelink_msp432p4_sdk_3_40_01_02/_
4. Go to: _Project ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Arm Linker ‚Üí File Search Path_ and add:
   - _msp432p4xx_driverlib.lib_ directory located in _[..]/source/ti/devices/msp432p4xx/driverlib/ccs/_
   - _grlib.a_ located in _[..]/source/ti/grlib/lib/ccs/m4f/_
5. Import `code/ESP32CAM_Smart_Surveillance`'s project in **Arduino IDE**
6. Download any remaining libraries in both IDEs, if not already installed
7. Open up **Telegram**, create a Telegram Bot and take note of its token and chat ID
8. Open the config.h file and insert the bot token and the chat ID
9. Insert the ssid and password values of a nearby detectable Wi-Fi connection in the same file
10. In the same file check if the Telegram SSL certificate is still valid: if not, replace it with a new one
11. Build and run the project on CCS to load the software on the MSP432   
12. Gently detach the ESP32 Cam from its support, connect it to the programming module, upload the Arduino code on it and reposition the camera back into place.

#### How to run
Once the firmware is loaded on both boards, it is sufficient to provide power to them to run everything properly.

## üßë‚Äçüíª User guide
To fully harness the capabilities of the system, carefully explore this section! <br>
- Make sure the cables do not disconnect while the servo turret is moving. This shouldn't happen if the cables are secure enough but some sudden sharp movements 
   by the camera could cause it to happen. To avoid the camera from moving too much (if you have a budget friendly setup like us), you can use some tape to keep
   it in place.

- Make sure the ESP32 Cam power supply is 5 V and at least 2 mA. The board is quite power hungry as it never goes to sleep to continue detecting motion.
 
- Play around with the motion constants (MOTION_THRESHOLD and MIN_PIXEL_CHANGE) to find the best set up that suits your situation! The MOTION_THRESHOLD is how
  much 2 pixels must differ from each other for them to be considered different. As a general guideline, you'll want this to be higher for birght environment, as 
  there is more fluctation, and lower for more dark environments. The MIN_PIXEL_CHANGE is how many pixels must be considered different for the system to decide
  there has been motion. We chose 3000 as it's around 4% of the frame's pixels but you can choose something higher for a more rigid system or something
  lower for a less strict system.
